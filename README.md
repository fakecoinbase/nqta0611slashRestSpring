# Rest - Spring Boot - CodeIgnitor
(On going project)
As I get bored of the Coronavirus pandemic quanrantine, I will make a webpage to keep track of all my daily activites inlcuding: how much I drink, eat, number of time opening the fridge, etc ....

A web app with:
  - Front End written in PHP, HTML, CSS using CodeIgnitor frameworks
  - Back End written in Java, MySQL using Spring Boot frameworks.
  
To Run the Project:
  1. Start mysql server from terminal with
    mysql.server start
  2. Run clean server by navigating into the backend folder
    ./mvnv clean spring-boot:run
